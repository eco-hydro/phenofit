A state-of-the-art **remote sensing vegetation phenology** extraction package: `phenofit`

 - `phenofit` combine merits of TIMESAT and phenopix
 - A simple and stable growing season dividing methods was proposed
 - Provide a practical snow elimination method, based on Whittaker
 - 7 curve fitting methods and 4 phenology extraction methods
 - We add parameters boundary for every curve fitting methods according to their ecological meaning.
 - `optimx` is used to select best optimization method for different curve fitting methods.


***Task lists***

- [ ] Test the performance of `phenofit` in multiple growing season regions (e.g. the North China Plain);
- [ ] Uncertainty analysis of curve fitting and phenological metrics;
- [x] shiny app has been moved to [phenofit.shiny](https://github.com/kongdd/phenofit.shiny);
- [x] Complete script automatic generating module in shinyapp;
- [x] `Rcpp` improve double logistics optimization efficiency by 60%;
- [x] Support spatial analysis;
- [x] Support annual season in curve fitting;
- [x] flexible fine fitting input ( original time-series or smoothed time-series by rough fitting).
- [x] Asymmetric of Threshold method
