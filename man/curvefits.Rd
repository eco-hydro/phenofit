\usage{
curvefits(INPUT, brks, wFUN = wTSM, iters = 2, wmin = 0.2,
  nextent = 2, maxExtendMonth = 3, minExtendMonth = 1, minT = 0,
  methods = c("AG", "zhang", "beck", "elmore", "Gu"), qc = INPUT$w * 0
  + 1, minPercValid = 0.2, print = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{INPUT}{A list object with the elements of 't', 'y', 'w', 'Tn' (option) 
and 'ylu', returned by \code{check_input}.}

\item{brks}{A list object with the elements of 'fit' and 'dt', returned by 
\code{season} or \code{season_3y}, which contains the growing season 
dividing information.}

\item{wFUN}{weights updating function, can be one of 'wTSM', 'wChen' and
'wBisquare'.}

\item{iters}{How many times curve fitting is implemented.}

\item{wmin}{Double, minimum weigth (i.e. weight of snow, ice and cloud).}

\item{nextent}{Extend curve fitting window, until \code{nextent} good or 
marginal element are found in previous and subsequent growing season.}

\item{maxExtendMonth}{Search good or marginal good values in previous and 
subsequent `maxExtendMonth` period.}

\item{minExtendMonth}{Extending perid defined by \code{nextent} and 
\code{maxExtendMonth} should be no shorter than \code{minExtendMonth}. 
When all points of the input time-series are good value, then the extending 
period will be too short. In that situation, we can't make sure the connection
between different growing seasons is smoothing.}

\item{minT}{Double, use night temperature Tn to define backgroud value. 
Tn < minT is treated as ungrowing season.}

\item{methods}{Character, find curve fitting names, can be one of 
c("AG", "zhang", "beck", "elmore", "Gu").}

\item{qc}{Factor (optional), only suit for MOD13A1. SummaryQA code for PhenoExtracr. 
Other dataset, just leave qc as the default.}

\item{minPercValid}{If valid percentage is less than \code{minPercValid}, the
fits are set to NA.}

\item{print}{Whether to print progress information?}

\item{...}{Other parameters will be ignore.}
