Description: 
    The merits of 'TIMESAT' and 'phenopix' are adopted. Besides, a simple and 
    growing season dividing method and a practical snow elimination method 
    based on Whittaker were proposed. 7 curve fitting methods and 4 phenology 
    extraction methods were provided. Parameters boundary are considered for 
    every curve fitting methods according to their ecological meaning. 
    And 'optimx' is used to select best optimization method for different 
    curve fitting methods.
